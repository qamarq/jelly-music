## About

Elovaire is designed for people who still care about music stored directly on their device.

The app gives albums, artists, playlists, lyrics, queue controls, and the now-playing screen a polished visual space without making the player feel noisy or overcomplicated. It is made to feel calm, responsive, and personal whether you are quickly starting a track or settling into a longer listening session.

Unlike streaming-first players, Elovaire focuses on local files and Android's media library. It is offline-first, tag-aware, and built to keep playback controls, artwork, search, and library navigation organized around your own collection.

## Highlights

- Offline-first playback for music stored on your Android device
- Artwork-led home, library, playlist, search, and now-playing screens
- Elegant, intuitive UI with frosted blur accents
- Smooth navigation and UI transitions
- Built-in update engine based on looking for the latest GitHub release
